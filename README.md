# Mario Kart Lounge Score Tracker
This application is written for the purposes of keeping track of scores from competitive Mario Kart events.
Each event consists of 12 players competing for the most points across 12 races.<br><br>

Typically, each event has one of the following formats:
1. FFA (every player competing for themselves)
2. 2v2 (6 teams of 2; randomly generated)
3. 3v3 (4 teams of 3; randomly generated)
4. 4v4 (3 teams of 4; randomly generated)
5. 6v6 (2 teams of 6; pre-determined)

This application will only handle the team-based formats (no FFA).
